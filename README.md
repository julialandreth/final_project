# Quentin Tarantino's Profane Use of Profanity 

### I looked at a dataset that recorded the swearwords in Quentin Tarantino movies.

The dataset only features data from Tarantino's first seven movies, which are:
* Reservoir Dogs (1992)
* Pulp Fiction (1994)
* Jackie Brown (1997)
* Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003)
* Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004)
* Inglorious Bastards (2009)
* Django Unchained (2012)

Here is the [Github data set](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/tarantino) I used for this project.

### The Process

The first thing I did was download the .CSV file of the data, and then I imported the .CSV to a Google sheet. 

Once the data imported, I was able to make different pivot tables to find out different things about the data set. 

I played around with different pivot tables, using different columns for rows and values.

Here are some of my fun findings!

### #1: Using a pivot table and then sorting the data by year, I found that over the years, Tarantino has featured less profanity in his movies. Pulp Fiction was his most profane movie thus far.

### #2: I ran another pivot table to find which words Tarantino uses most, across all his films. 

Interesting!

### #3: I ran yet another pivot table to find out how long it took for each movie to feature a swear word. I used the "minimum" function to figure this out!

### #4: Next, I grabbed some more data of box office revenues for the films. I put this side-by-side with the number of swear words in each movie.

I didn't see a huge connection.
