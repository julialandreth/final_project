# Final project for Julia Landreth

### I looked at a dataset that recorded the swearwords in Quentin Tarantion movies. 
The dataset only features data from Tarantino's first seven movies, which are:
* Reservoir Dogs (1992)
* Pulp Fiction (1994)
* Jackie Brown (1997)
* Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003)
* Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004)
* Inglorious Bastards (2009)
* Django Unchained (2012)

Here is the [link](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/tarantino) to the data set I used for this project.

### The Process

The first thing I did was download the .CSV file of the data, and then I imported the .CSV to a Google sheet. 

Once the data imported, I was able to make different pivot tables to find out different things about the data set. 

I played around with different pivot tables, using different columns for rows and values. Here are some of my fun findings.

### #1: Using a pivot table and then sorting the data by year, I found that over the years, Tarantino has featured less profanity in his movies. Pulp Fiction was his most profane movie thus far.

### #2: I ran another pivot table to find which words Tarantino uses most, across all his films.
