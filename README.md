# Quentin Tarantino's Profane Use of Profanity 

by Julia Landreth

#### I looked at a dataset that recorded the swearwords in Quentin Tarantino movies.

Quentin Tarantino is an American filmaker known for violent films with nonlinear stories. I chose this dataset because I thought it was funny, and I thought it would be cool to see if there was any connection between profanity and the success/failure of his movies.

The dataset only features data from Tarantino's first seven movies, which are:
* Reservoir Dogs (1992)
* Pulp Fiction (1994)
* Jackie Brown (1997)
* Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003)
* Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004)
* Inglorious Bastards (2009)
* Django Unchained (2012)

It would have been cool to have data on all of his movies, but this was a good place to start. 

Here is the [Github data set](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/tarantino) I used for this project.

#### The Process

The first thing I did was download the .CSV file of the data, and then I imported the .CSV to a Google sheet. I was lucky that the data was already super clean and oragnized. Once the data imported, I was able to make a bunch of different pivot tables to find out different things about the data set. I played around with the different pivot tables, using different columns for rows and values. I made the data visualizations on Data Wrapper. I also ended up finding another data set and adding that to my original dataset in order to look at the box office numbers.

Here are some of my fun findings!

#### #1: Over the Years?

The original data didn't supply the years of the films, so I decided to add those in myself using parentheses. Then, using a pivot table and sorting the data by year, I found that over the years, Tarantino has featured less profanity in his movies. Pulp Fiction was his most profane movie thus far. I was surprised to see how low the bottom three movies were.

#### #2: Which Words?

I ran another pivot table to find which words Tarantino uses most, across all his films. Interesting!

#### #3: When?

I ran yet another pivot table to find out how long it took for each movie to feature a swear word. I used the "minimum" function to figure this out! I thought this was interesting, and I wouldn't have expected a 20 minute delay for Inglorious Bastards!

#### #4: Connection?
Finally, I grabbed some additional data on the box office revenues for the films. I put this side-by-side with the number of swear words in each movie. I didn't see a huge connection.

Here's a [link](https://screenrant.com/quentin-tarantinos-movies-ranked-by-box-office-gross-according-to-box-office-mojo/) to that data.

#### That's all for now!
